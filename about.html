  <br />
  <br>
  <p>
    I am a hard-working, cheerful and empathetic person who enjoys working in a team, as well as on my own. I have a creative side, and am always keen to learn new skills. I am conscientious and patient in all parts of my work and particularly in my writing, coding and organisational skills. I am actively seeking the opportunity to use the knowledge and skills I‚Äôve learned over the years in innovative new ways, and for a new and stimulating challenge in my career.
  </p>
  <p>
    My background is in catering, events and hospitality, and I have worked as a head and events chef for over 15 years in high-end establishments across the UK. After graduating in BA(Hons) Hospitality Management, I went for interviews at some highly regarded cake decorators and catering companies in London and ended up working at the prestigious Rhubarb Food Design as a Canap√© Chef and Maisie Fantaisie as a freelance cake decorator for several years after, two highly regarded companies in their fields. I ended up working on events including Elton John‚Äôs White Tie & Tiara Ball and also for the President of Gabon. After a spell of travelling and working in Cambodia and the French Alps, I came back to London and did a further two years at the Royal Albert Hall, in between a few more ski seasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Four years in London was enough for me and after a brief visit to Edinburgh during the festival I was convinced it was the place for me! Countryside, beautiful city and no underground, perfect! When I first settled in Edinburgh I worked as Head Chef at a varying number of places including Jupiter Artland, a sculpture park near Ratho, and received one of my biggest achievements to date, a 90% review from the Scotsman! Having gained this I knew that I had it in me to set up my own business.
  </p>
  <p>
    With five years of running my own small business I became proficient in selling a brand, interacting with customers to create and write content for social media across all platforms, and become innovative in developing new products, marketing ideas and creating websites through Wordpress. From this my interest in website design began. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For the past five months I have been increasing my knowledge of web design and marketing with SheCodes, and have a sound knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as SEO. I am well versed in all Google apps, as well as Slack, Zoom and all social media platforms. I also pride myself on being able to pick up new programmes and projects quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also currently working 4hrs a week at Love Her Wild, a women's outdoor charity, on their End2End Relay. This involves over 600 women walking the length of Britain over 74 days. I am involved in the marketing of the event, as well as sponsorship, advertising, retaining and attracting members.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am passionate about website design and you can guarantee that you will get a high-end experience working with myself. I specialise in food and drink businesses, but I would love to work with any businesses who are passionate about their product or service. 
  </p>
