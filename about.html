  <br />
  <p>
    Coupled with outstanding flavours and just a hell of a lot of chocolate, and
    with years of experience in some of London & Edinburgh‚Äôs best cake and
    catering companies, we pride ourselves on providing products that do not
    compromise in taste or flavour in anyway.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ÄúHaving always had a love for baking and cooking, I started my way into the
    industry by deciding to study Hospitality Management at Bournemouth
    University and Cake Decorating at Bournemouth and Poole College at the age
    of 18. After graduating, I went for interviews at some highly regarded cake
    decorators and catering companies in London and ended up working at the
    prestigious Rhubarb Food Design as a Canap√© Chef and Maisie Fantaisie as a
    freelance cake decorator for several years after, two highly regarded
    companies in their fields. I ended up working on events including Elton
    John‚Äôs White Tie & Tiara Ball and also for the President of Gabon. After a
    spell of travelling and working in Cambodia and the French Alps, I came back
    to London and did a further two years at the Royal Albert Hall, in between a
    few more ski seasons.
  </p>

    Four years in London was enough for me and after a brief visit to Edinburgh
    during the festival I was convinced it was the place for me! Countryside,
    beautiful city and no underground, perfect! When I first settled in
    Edinburgh I worked as Head Chef at a varying number of places including
    Jupiter Artland, a sculpture park near Ratho, and received one of my biggest
    achievements to date, a 90% review from the Scotsman! Having gained this I
    knew that I had it in me to set up my own business. Patisserie and baking
    were always a passion for me, so I took courses and spent hours researching
    start-ups and business ideas, and here I am today, providing Scotland with
    the best brownies out there!‚Äù
